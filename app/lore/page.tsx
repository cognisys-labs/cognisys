          <p>
            Cognisys Labs draws deep inspiration from Asimov&apos;s &quot;I,
            Robot&quot; series, where robot psychologists like Dr. Susan Calvin
            were essential in understanding and resolving complex ethical
            dilemmas faced by artificial minds.
          </p>

          <p>
            In today&apos;s world, AI systems face similar challenges. They make
            real-world decisions with inherent biases, ethical blind spots, and
            complex logical conflicts. This is where modern robot psychology
            becomes crucial:

            Cognisys Labs operates as a large-scale initiative where users
            become robot psychologists, challenging AI models with complex
            ethical scenarios. Every interaction is transparently recorded on
            the blockchain, and users who successfully challenge the AI earn
            recognition through badges and tokens.
